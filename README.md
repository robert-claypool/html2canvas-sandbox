html2canvas Sandbox
===================
An HTML page to test elements that work and don't work with
https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/

## Running Locally
https://github.com/indexzero/http-server is an easy choice, but any web server
will do.
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/robert-claypool/html2canvas-sandbox.git
cd html2canvas-sandbox
npm install --global http-server
http-server # defaults to port 8080, http://localhost:8080/index.html
```
